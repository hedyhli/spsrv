## Reporting a Vulnerability

Send an email to **hedy at tilde dot cafe**.

Do NOT use my public inbox on lists.sr.ht or tell me publicly since other public
servers running on spsrv (not only yours) could be prone to the same issue.

=> [mailto link](mailto:hedy@tilde.cafe)

You can expect emails to be read within a week, and I will reply promply to indicate when
I'll be able to work on a fix, if possible.
