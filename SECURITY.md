# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Version of the server used should be included when reporting vulnerabilities,
however please try to use the latest versions if you are the server admin.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Send an email to `hedy.dev AT protonmail.com`.

Do NOT use my public inbox on lists.sr.ht or tell me publicly since other public
servers running on spsrv (not only yours) could be prone to the same issue.

=> [mailto link](mailto:hedy.dev@protonmail.com)

You can expect emails to be read within a week, and I will reply promptly to indicate when
I'll be able to work on a fix, if possible.
